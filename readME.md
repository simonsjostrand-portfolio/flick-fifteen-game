# Flick Seventeen 🎮

A number puzzle game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🕹️ How to Play

- Your goal is to reach **exactly 17** in any of the four slots using the current "flick" number.
- Click a **Flick** button below a slot to add the current number to that slot.
- Reaching exactly 17 in a slot scores a point and resets that slot.
- If a slot goes **above 17**, it resets to 0 and subtracts one point.
- You win by reaching **10 points** within **70 flicks**.
- Dropping below 0 points = game over.
- Your **high score** is determined by how few flicks you used to win — the closer to 70, the better.

## ✨ Features

- Animated overlays for **start**, **win**, and **loss** states.
- Game rules modal with easy access.
